# promogaming

This project is my end school project.  
We were 5 people on it, 3 front-dev (React) and 2 back-dev (Symfony). 
I did the API consumption, added pagination, and worked on the API to give data for front website.  
API consumption is not finished yet, i'm working on personnal stuff.
But I will back on it to finish the API consumption because it needs lot of work to get a fully working and automated service.
If you know how to manage to get hundred thousand of games data from an API, it would really help me to get some contact with you, I have few tracks for this features, nothing sure.


Thank you !!
